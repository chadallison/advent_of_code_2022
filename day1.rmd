### loading tidyverse

```{r message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

### importing input

```{r}
input = readLines("day1_input.txt")
input[1:50]
```

### formatting the data

```{r}
df = data.frame(cals = input) |>
  mutate(elf = cumsum(cals == "") + 1,
         cals = as.numeric(cals)) |>
  filter(!is.na(cals)) |>
  group_by(elf) |>
  summarise(cals = sum(cals)) |>
  arrange(desc(cals))

head(df)
```

this tells us the elf with the most calories is elf #238 carrying 68,442 calories. now we need to find the total calories carried by the top three elves.

```{r}
sum(df[1:3, ]$cals)
```

the top three elves carrying the most calories are carrying 204,837 calories in total.
